<h3>👋 Welcome to GTA 5 Spoofer</h3>
<p>Banned in GTA Online? Don't stress — we’re here to help.<br>
We’re a dedicated team creating reliable tools to <strong>spoof your hardware ID (HWID)</strong> and bypass Rockstar Games bans effortlessly. Our tools are open-source, community-supported, and frequently updated to ensure you stay undetected and back in the action in GTA Online.</p>

<h3>🔍 Understanding GTA 5 HWID Bans</h3>
<p>Rockstar Games actively uses hardware identification (HWID) bans to enforce game fairness. When you're banned, Rockstar identifies your computer hardware, making it difficult to simply create a new account to bypass the restriction. A GTA 5 HWID Spoofer works by altering or masking your computer’s unique hardware identifiers, effectively allowing you to bypass these restrictions.</p>

<h3>💡 How Does a GTA 5 Spoofer Work?</h3>
<p>An effective GTA 5 HWID spoofer will alter identifiers such as serial numbers, MAC addresses, disk IDs, motherboard IDs, GPU serial numbers, and other hardware identifiers Rockstar uses to track and enforce bans. By spoofing these identifiers, your hardware appears completely new to GTA 5 servers, allowing you to safely create a new account and re-enter Los Santos without detection.</p>

<h3>🛡️ Staying Undetected: Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Always follow the latest setup guides carefully.</li>
  <li>Regularly update your spoofer to match the current anti-cheat versions.</li>
  <li>Never share personal information or details about your spoofing process online.</li>
  <li>Avoid using cheats or exploits alongside spoofers to minimize detection risk.</li>
</ul>
